# react-express-starter

bare-bones [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/) starter
using as [express](https://npmjs.com/package/express) server
and [reactify](https://npmjs.com/package/reactify) for jsx
under [browserify](http://browserify.org)/[watchify](https://npmjs.com/package/watchify)
with [npm run scripts](http://substack.net/task_automation_with_npm_run)

Based on [react-starter](https://github.com/substack/react-starter) by substack,
with an added express backend. Emphasis is on developer usability over production
performance (no universal apps etc.)
